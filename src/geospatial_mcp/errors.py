"""Error types.

Design rule, and the single most important behavioural contract in this
package: **tools raise, they never return an error payload.**

Returning ``{"status": "error", ...}`` from a failed tool is the tempting shape
and the wrong one. MCP marks such a response ``is_error=False``, so the model
reads the failure as a success and proceeds on made-up data. Raising sets
``is_error=True`` and puts the message in front of the model, which can then
correct itself.

Two tiers:

* :class:`GeoInputError` and its subclasses -- the model can plausibly recover.
  The message reaches the model, so it must say what was received, why that is
  wrong, and show a valid example.
* :class:`GeoConfigError` -- operator misconfiguration the model cannot fix
  (missing API key, bad base URL). Raised as ``MCPError`` so the host sees it.
