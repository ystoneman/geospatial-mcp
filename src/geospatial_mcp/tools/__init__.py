"""Toolset registry.

Tools are grouped into toolsets that can be enabled independently. This exists
for one reason: every tool definition costs context in the model's window on
every single turn, whether or not it is used. A server that exposes fifty tools
by default is quietly taxing every conversation.

The default set (``core`` + ``rf``) is 22 tools, about 40 KB of ``tools/list``.
Everything else is opt-in via ``GEO_TOOLSETS`` or ``--toolsets``.

Selection follows the pattern the GitHub MCP server established::

    GEO_TOOLSETS=default          core + rf                    (22 tools)
    GEO_TOOLSETS=all              every toolset
    GEO_TOOLSETS=offline          every tool that needs no network
    GEO_TOOLSETS=core,analysis    an explicit list
