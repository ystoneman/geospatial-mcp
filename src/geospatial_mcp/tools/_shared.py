#: When is a place name ambiguous? Calibrated against live Nominatim rankings.
#:
#: Nominatim's ``importance`` (0-1) is its estimate of how prominent a place is.
#: Two candidates are rival readings of one name when their importance is close
#: *and* they are far apart -- "Springfield" returns Illinois at 0.613 and
#: Massachusetts at 0.611, 1456 km away. Closeness alone is not enough: "Paris"
#: returns two objects at 0.897, the city relation and its administrative
#: boundary, 2 km apart, which are the same place. Distance alone is not enough
#: either: "Paris" also returns Paris, Texas, but at 0.530, and nobody asking for
#: "Paris" is owed a question about Texas.
#:
#: Within ``_TIE_PROMINENCE`` the tool refuses to guess ("Springfield",
#: "Cambridge"). Within ``MENTION_PROMINENCE`` it answers, but names the others
#: ("Portland" -> Oregon, also Maine; "Newcastle" -> upon Tyne, also NSW).

#: A geometry argument as it can actually arrive over the wire.
#:
#: The MCP SDK parses any JSON-looking string argument into a Python object
#: before validating it against the tool signature. A parameter declared ``str``
#: that receives ``'{"type":"Point",...}'`` is therefore handed a ``dict`` and
#: fails with "Input should be a valid string" -- even though the client sent
#: exactly what the description asked for. Models also legitimately send GeoJSON
#: as a nested object rather than a string. Accepting both is the only
#: interoperable choice, and ``as_geometry_text`` normalises it.
