Every other module in this package imports MCP types from here. When the SDK
changes shape -- as it did between 1.x (``mcp.server.fastmcp.FastMCP``) and
2.x (``mcp.server.MCPServer``) -- exactly one file needs editing.

Do not ``import mcp`` anywhere else. ``tests/mcp/test_sdk_isolation.py``
enforces this.
