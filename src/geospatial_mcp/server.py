INSTRUCTIONS = """\
Geospatial toolkit: coordinates, geocoding, routing, terrain, weather and radio links.

Any tool taking a `location` accepts decimal degrees ("48.8584,2.2945"), DMS, \
a USNG/MGRS grid reference, geohash, H3, a Plus Code, or a place name to geocode. \
Decimal degrees are canonical; latitude comes first.

Picking the right tool:
- Straight-line distance -> geom_measure. Travel distance and time -> route_directions.
- Travel times between many places -> route_matrix, one call, not repeated route_directions.
- Everywhere reachable in N minutes -> route_isochrone.
- Ground height along a path -> terrain_profile. At one point -> terrain_elevation.
- One named place -> place_geocode. A category of place nearby -> place_search.
- Coordinate notation change -> coord_convert. Datum or projection change -> \
coord_transform_crs.

Results carry a `meta` block with the data source and its required attribution; \
pass that through when showing results to a user. `meta.notes` carries accuracy \
caveats worth repeating.

If a capability seems missing, call geo_capabilities before concluding it is \
unavailable -- it may be in a toolset that is switched off.

    This is a correctness requirement, not a preference. The MCP stdio transport
