"""Coordinate reference system transforms, with honest accuracy reporting.

The reason this module exists rather than a one-line ``pyproj.transform`` call:
PROJ ships without the high-accuracy datum-shift grids (NTv2, NADCON, geoid
models). When a transform needs one and it is absent, PROJ does not fail -- it
silently falls back to a three-parameter Helmert shift that can be several
metres out. Most tooling hides this. A surveyor or an insurance underwriter
placing a boundary needs to know.

So every transform reports the operation PROJ actually used for *this* point
and the accuracy PROJ publishes for it, flags ``ballpark=True`` when PROJ found
no published transformation at all and fell back to ignoring the datum shift,
and names the grid file a more accurate operation would need.

The operation is read after the transform, per point, rather than from the
transformer. A transformer built with ``from_crs`` picks an operation at
transform time by area of use -- NAD27 alone has dozens, one per region -- so
"the transformer's accuracy" is not a meaningful number until a point has gone
through it, and PROJ reports -1 (unknown) before then.

Network grids stay opt-in. ``PROJ_NETWORK=ON`` lets PROJ fetch grids from
cdn.proj.org on demand, which turns a local computation into a network call;
where that fetch fails -- a firewall, a proxy -- PROJ returns infinities rather
than an error, and :func:`transform_point` falls back to the best operation
that does not need the missing grid, saying so.
