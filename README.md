# geospatial-mcp

<!-- mcp-name: io.github.ystoneman/geospatial -->

An MCP server for geospatial work: coordinates, geocoding, routing, terrain,
weather and radio links. 22 tools, no API key required for any of them.

Built for logistics, telecom, agriculture, insurance, real estate, utilities,
emergency response, surveying and mapping — anywhere a question starts with
*where*.

```
"How long to drive from the depot to the customer?"          route_directions
"Everywhere a van can reach in 20 minutes"                   route_isochrone
"Which depot is closest by road to each of today's jobs?"    route_matrix
"How steep is this section of the trail?"                    terrain_profile
"How far will a 1800 MHz cell reach over suburban ground?"   rf_link_budget
"What's the area of this field in hectares?"                 geom_measure
"Convert this grid reference the survey crew gave me"        coord_convert
```

## Install

Nothing to clone or build. Every client below runs the server with `uvx`.

## Tools

Every tool taking a `location` accepts **any** of these, interchangeably:

```
48.8584, 2.2945          decimal degrees (canonical, latitude first)
48°51'30"N 2°17'40"E     degrees / minutes / seconds

891fb46741bffff          H3 cell
8FW4V75V+9R6             Plus Code
Eiffel Tower, Paris      a place name, geocoded for you
```

Link budgets are an everyday tool for mobile operators, wireless ISPs,
utilities running SCADA telemetry and IoT fleets: how far a radio reaches for a
given power, frequency and environment.

This is one server among many. If you are working out which to use, Sparkgeo's
[geo-mcp-servers](https://github.com/sparkgeo/geo-mcp-servers) is a curated,
machine-checked index of the geospatial MCP field, kept current and marked for
liveness — a better place to compare coverage than any claim this README could
make about itself. [docs/REFERENCES.md](docs/REFERENCES.md) lists the servers,
standards and research this project leans on or points at.

### Selecting toolsets

```bash
uvx geospatial-mcp --toolsets core       # 20 tools, drops the RF set
uvx geospatial-mcp --toolsets all        # adds the analysis toolset (needs [stats])
GEO_TOOLSETS=offline uvx geospatial-mcp  # 13 tools that never touch the network
uvx geospatial-mcp --list-tools          # print the catalogue and exit
```

`offline` is for field use with no signal. It keeps only tools that make no
network call under *any* input, so it excludes `geom_measure` and the place
tools — those accept a place name, which means they may geocode.

| Toolset | Tools | Needs |
|---|--:|---|
| `core` | 20 | nothing |
| `rf` | 2 | nothing |
| `analysis` | 2 | `geospatial-mcp[stats]` |

## Configuration

No API key is needed for anything. Every keyed provider has a keyless default.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GEO_TOOLSETS` | `default`, `all`, `offline`, or a comma-separated list |
| `GEO_CACHE_DIR` | Response cache location (default `~/.cache/geospatial-mcp`) |
| `GEO_CACHE` | `0` disables the disk cache |
| `GEO_USER_AGENT` | Override the User-Agent sent to providers |
| `NOMINATIM_URL`, `PHOTON_URL`, `OVERPASS_URL`, `VALHALLA_URL`, `OPEN_METEO_BASE_URL` | Point at self-hosted instances |
| `OPENROUTESERVICE_API_KEY` | Optional routing upgrade over the keyless default |
| `OPENCELLID_API_KEY` | Optional; larger cell-tower database |
| `OPEN_METEO_API_KEY` | Required for **commercial** weather use (see below) |

### Data sources and licensing

Results carry the attribution their licence requires in `meta.attribution` —
pass it through when you display them. Two obligations worth knowing before you
build on this: OpenStreetMap-derived data (geocoding, places, routing) is
**ODbL 1.0** and requires attribution, and **Open-Meteo's free tier is
non-commercial**, so commercial deployments need `OPEN_METEO_API_KEY` or a
self-hosted instance.

The public instances are free and shared. This server caches aggressively and
rate-limits per host to stay inside their usage policies; for heavy use,
self-host and set the corresponding `*_URL`. See
[Sources and credits](#sources-and-credits) for the complete list.

## What it gets right that is easy to get wrong

- **Distances and areas are geodesic.** Karney's algorithm on the WGS84
  ellipsoid, accurate to millimetres at any distance. Not `111.32 km/degree`,
  which is 0.25% out at 60° latitude and worse further north.
- **Buffers are circles on the ground.** Buffering in degrees produces an
  ellipse stretched by 1/cos(latitude) — 2× wrong at 60°, 5× at 78°. Every
  buffer here is projected to an azimuthal equidistant plane first.
- **Grid references truncate, they never round.** A reference names the square a
  position falls in, so dropping digits must move the point to the coarser
  square's corner. Rounding would hand back a neighbouring square — a kilometre
  away at four digits, and confidently wrong.
- **DEM gaps stay gaps.** A missing elevation is reported as `null`, never
  substituted with zero. Substituting sea level flattens a ridge into an
  entirely plausible plain, and every statistic downstream inherits it.
- **Place names are never silently guessed.** "Springfield" matches cities of
  near-equal prominence 1,500 km apart, so a tool asked about it lists them and
  asks, rather than quietly answering for Illinois. When a name is clear enough
  to use, `meta.notes` says exactly which place it was taken to mean, and names
  any others that share it.
- **Errors are errors.** Failures raise, so the MCP response is marked
  `isError`. A tool that returns `{"status": "error"}` is reported to the model
  as a success, and it will proceed on invented data.
- **Empirical models report their limits.** COST231-Hata outside 1500–2000 MHz
  still returns a number; `meta.notes` tells you it is out of range.
- **CRS transforms admit their accuracy.** Every transform names the operation
  PROJ used for that point and its published accuracy. When a better operation
  needs a grid file that is not installed, the response names the file; when no
  published transformation exists at all, it says the datum shift was ignored.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ystoneman/geospatial-mcp && cd geospatial-mcp
uv sync --all-extras
make check          # lint, types, tests — exactly what CI runs
make test-network   # additionally hit the live APIs
make evals          # tool-selection eval suite
```

## Sources and credits

Almost none of the geospatial computation here is ours. This package is an
integration layer: it chooses which established libraries, published algorithms
and public data services to expose to a language model, wires them together, and
tries hard to get the units, datums and error handling right. The interesting
work was done by the projects below, and this section exists so you can see
exactly which ones you are depending on.

To put a number on it — of the Python that ships when you install this package,
**1.0% is ours and 99.0% is dependencies** (6,912 lines against 654,791), inside
a 150 MB installation of which 109 MB is compiled native libraries and 9 MB is
the EPSG registry. Counted by installing the package with no extras into an
empty environment and measuring `site-packages`.

### Native libraries bundled inside those wheels

| Library | Licence | Reached through |
|---|---|---|
| [GEOS](https://libgeos.org) | **LGPL-2.1-or-later** | `shapely` — used unmodified and dynamically linked; see [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for how the licence is satisfied |
| [PROJ](https://proj.org) | MIT | `pyproj`, with the EPSG registry |

GEOS is the one copyleft component in the tree. It is unavoidable — it sits
under Shapely, GeoPandas, OGR, PostGIS and DuckDB-spatial alike, and there is no
permissive replacement with equivalent overlay correctness.

### Live data services

None require an API key. Results carry the attribution their licence demands in
`meta.attribution`; pass it through when you display them.

### Algorithms, and where they come from

Every computation in this package traces to a library, a published formula or a
public service. None of it was invented here, and the literature is cited so you
can check the implementation against the source.

| Capability | Implemented by | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Geodesic distance, bearing, area | PROJ, via `pyproj.Geod` | Karney, C. F. F. (2013), "Algorithms for geodesics", *Journal of Geodesy* 87(1), 43–55 |
| Datum and projection transforms | PROJ | The EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset |
| USNG / MGRS grid references | `pygeodesy` | FGDC-STD-011-2001, the United States National Grid; the same squares are MGRS outside the US |
| Polygon overlay, buffering, hulls | GEOS, via `shapely` | The OGC Simple Features specification |
| Line simplification | GEOS | Douglas, D. H. & Peucker, T. K. (1973), *The Canadian Cartographer* 10(2), 112–122 |
| Hexagonal spatial index | `h3` | Uber H3 |

| Okumura-Hata path loss | this package | Hata, M. (1980), *IEEE Trans. Veh. Technol.* 29(3), 317–325; after Okumura et al. (1968) |
| COST 231-Hata path loss | this package | COST Action 231 final report (1999), ch. 4 |
| Two-ray ground reflection | this package | Standard textbook propagation model |
| Slope, aspect, hillshade | this package | Horn, B. K. P. (1981), "Hill shading and the reflectance map", *Proc. IEEE* 69(1), 14–47 |
| Terrarium DEM decode | this package | Mapzen Terrain Tiles published encoding |
| Sun and moon position | `astral` | Standard astronomical almanac formulae |

| HDBSCAN clustering | `scikit-learn` | Campello, R. J. G. B. et al. (2013), *PAKDD* |

"Implemented by: this package" means the formula was written out from the cited
publication in [`geo/rf.py`](src/geospatial_mcp/geo/rf.py) or
[`geo/terrain.py`](src/geospatial_mcp/geo/terrain.py), because no permissively
licensed Python library implements it. The mathematics is not ours; only the
transcription is.

### What this package actually adds

Given the above, it is worth being plain about what is left:

- **The composition** — which capabilities belong in one server, and what the
  tool surface should look like for a model rather than a human.
- **Correct units and datums at the seams.** Geodesic buffering via an azimuthal
  equidistant reprojection, geodesic path sampling, geodesic area — the places
  where naive degree arithmetic silently gives wrong answers.
- **A shared HTTP layer** with per-host rate limiting, a disk cache, bounded
  retries and mirror failover, so the free public services are used within their
  stated policies.
- **Error design** — tools raise rather than returning an error payload, and
  every message names the input, the problem and a valid example.
- **Attribution plumbing**, so licence obligations travel with the data.
- **Tests and evals** — 293 tests and a 31-case tool-selection eval library.

Full licence texts and obligations are in
[THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). If you spot a missing or
incorrect attribution, please open an issue — that is a bug.
