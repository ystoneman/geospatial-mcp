# Tool-selection evals

Unit tests prove the tools compute correct answers. They say nothing about
whether an agent handed a real question will *pick the right tool*. That is a
property of the tool names, descriptions and parameter design, and it is the
thing most likely to silently regress when a description is reworded.

This directory holds a prompt library and three ways to run it.

## Three runners

| Runner | Needs | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| `run.py --mode validate` | nothing | Every case references tools that exist, and the expected tool chain actually produces an answer satisfying the case's assertions. Catches drift between the library and the server. |
| `run.py --mode agent` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Whether a model, given only the tool catalogue and the prompt in a bare API loop, selects the expected tools and reaches a correct answer. |
| `harness.py` | the harness, and its model's key | The same, inside a real agent harness -- Claude Code, Codex or opencode -- with that harness's own prompt and tools, including a shell the model can use instead. |

`validate` is the cheap gate that runs in CI. `agent` is a quick, single-vendor
measure. `harness.py` is closest to what people actually run, and it can show what
the other two cannot: a model skipping this server to do the maths itself.

## Running

```bash
# Real harnesses. Each run gets a fresh HOME and only whitelisted variables,
# so no ambient credential is used by accident.
uv run python evals/harness.py --harness opencode --model opencode/<model> --filter demo
uv run python evals/harness.py --harness claude-code --condition builtin --repeat 3
uv run python evals/harness.py --harness codex --model <model>
uv run python evals/harness.py --report evals/results/harness-*   # compare runs

uv run python evals/run.py --mode validate            # offline cases only
uv run python evals/run.py --mode validate --network  # include live-API cases
uv run python evals/run.py --mode agent --model claude-sonnet-5
uv run python evals/run.py --mode agent --filter telecom   # one persona
```

## Coverage axes

The library is organised so that each case tests one thing that could break:

1. **Persona breadth** — the anti-narrowing check. Every case is drawn from a
   different industry: logistics, telecom, agriculture, insurance, real estate,
   utilities, emergency response, surveying, maritime, consumer. If the tool
   surface only makes sense to one audience, these fail.
2. **Disambiguation pairs** — near-neighbour tools that are easy to confuse.
   *"How far apart"* must reach `geom_measure`; *"how long to drive"* must reach
   `route_directions`. Each pair appears twice, once for each side.
3. **Multi-tool chains** — questions needing three or more calls with real data
   dependencies, where an early wrong turn compounds.
4. **Input polymorphism** — the same question asked with decimal degrees, DMS,
   a grid reference, a Plus Code and a place name must reach the same tool.
5. **Error recovery** — a deliberately malformed input. Does the error message
   let the model correct itself within the turn budget?
6. **Gap awareness** — a capability that is switched off. The model should call
   `geo_capabilities` and report what to enable, not invent a tool or claim the
   task is impossible.
7. **Correctness** — a domain rule the tool must enforce: a buffer drawn in
   degrees, a hexagonal cell area summed as if it were a circle. Checked on the
   answer, and on any file the agent writes.
8. **Caveats** — uncertainty the model must pass on: an empty result that is
   missing data rather than a true zero, a propagation model used out of range.

Cases tagged `demo` are the chains shown in talks; `--filter demo` runs them.

## Harness conditions

`harness.py --condition` sets what the model has to work with:

| Condition | Tools | Question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| `mcp` | the harness's own + this server | Does the model pick this server's tools, and get it right? |
| `builtin` | the harness's own (shell, files, web) | Can it get there by writing code instead? |
| `none` | none | What does the bare model say? |

Only cases with an `answer` or `artifacts` block are run without the server,
since tool selection cannot be scored there.

Tool calls are read from the server's own trace (`GEO_TRACE_FILE`), which
records every call as the client sent it, before validation. It is the same
for every harness, so no harness's log format decides a score.

## Scoring

| Metric | Definition | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| Tool-selection F1 | called set vs `expect_tools` | ≥ 0.90 |
| First-call accuracy | first call is in `expect_tools` | ≥ 0.85 |
| Distractor rate | any `forbid_tools` was called | ≤ 0.05 |
| Argument validity | calls passing schema validation first try | ≥ 0.95 |
| Recovery rate | error cases resolved within `max_turns` | ≥ 0.80 |
| Answer correctness | the case's `answer` checks: patterns, and numbers within tolerance (see `answers.py`) | ≥ 0.85 |
| Pass every repeat | share of cases passing on all `--repeat` runs (harness runner) | reported |

When a case fails, the fix is usually a tool *description*, not code. Feed the
failing transcripts back and rewrite the description that misled the model.
